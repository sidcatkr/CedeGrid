# Validation

This page summarizes what automated checks cover, which operational gates remain open,
and the rules for validation runs. The qualification status of the current release is
recorded in the [release record](release-0.2-gates.json) and the
[release evidence](release-0.2-evidence.md).

## Automated checks

Continuous integration runs on every push and pull request:

- Linux x86_64 and arm64, macOS arm64 and x86_64:
  - formatting, Clippy with warnings denied and the serial Rust test suite
  - the Python SDK and tool tests
  - `doctor` and `observe` smoke runs
- Windows: client-path compilation, plus the `policy`, `telemetry` and `cli` tests.
- Rust 1.88: all-target check.
- SDKs: Python 3.10–3.14 and Node 22.14 and later.

Passing on macOS, or cross-compiling, does not establish Linux runtime behavior.

## Open operational gates

- **Multiple physical nodes.** Not yet verified on physical hosts:
  - useful work from two nodes
  - loss and rejoin of a node
  - checkpoint transfer between nodes
- **GPU.** Not yet verified on hardware:
  - managed execution on an empty device
  - sharing and protection on an occupied device

  Freshness is never inferred from aggregate utilization or from an NVML `NotFound` response.
- **Storage.** A FUSE-backed filesystem without a supported directory-sync barrier is not
  qualified for durable namespace publication. The replayable profile tolerates process crashes
  only.
- **Endurance.** A long-duration soak has not been run. Bounded stress is the release
  requirement.

## Rules for validation runs

- Report these statuses separately:
  - implementation
  - Linux-native rootless execution
  - optional controls
  - multi-node work
  - fault and recovery
  - bounded stress
  - soak
- Uncertain allocations stay reserved until verified reconciliation. Failure injection affects
  only test-owned processes and connections. Unrelated processes are never signalled.
- Use an isolated run directory under the operator's home. Preserve original datasets,
  checkpoints and failed evidence.
- Targets:
  - zero ownership, accounting or result violations
  - matched managed throughput ≥ 90%
  - manager RSS ≤ 512 MiB per node
  - manager CPU ≤ 0.1 logical CPU idle and ≤ 0.5 active
  - decision p95 ≤ 1 s
  - release p95 ≤ 10 s after the decision
  - protected post-yield p99 ≤ 1.20× baseline
  - coordinator recovery ≤ 60 s
  - node rejoin ≤ 90 s
- Report detection, drain, termination and release separately. Insufficient samples are
  inconclusive. Higher CPU utilization alone is not a speedup.
- Every run manifest records:
  - the exact source and environment
  - seeds and worker counts
  - time bounds and scope
  - raw measurements and cleanup
- After a failure or a scoped change, rerun only the affected checks and append the results.

tools, and [guarantees](guarantees.md) for the support boundary.
